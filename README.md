🏨 Enhancing Hotel Recommendations with AI
CMPE 255 — Data Mining Short Story Assignment

Author: Alekya Gudise

🧩 Project Overview

This repository contains my CMPE 255 Data Mining Short Story Project, based on the research paper:

📄 "HotelReview-Eval: A Framework for Evaluating Hotel Review-Based Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs"
arXiv, 2025
🔗 Paper Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18277

This project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance hotel recommendation systems through:

Review summarization

Query-driven insights

Sentiment + preference extraction

Explanation-driven decision support

The goal of the short story is to translate the research into a user-friendly, human-readable narrative while retaining core data mining concepts.

🧠 Core Data Mining Concepts Demonstrated

This short story touches on several core data mining and machine learning concepts:

Text mining & semantic analysis

Query-based information retrieval

Sentiment extraction from reviews

LLM-driven summarization

Evaluation frameworks for hotel recommendations

Human-AI collaboration in decision making

Personalization using embeddings

📘 Paper Summary

Key ideas from the research:

LLMs outperform traditional models in review understanding, context reasoning, and user-specific recommendations.

Structured evaluation frameworks like HotelReview-Eval reveal how models behave across different query types.

LLMs excel at subjective, open-ended questions but may struggle with numeric precision.

The study proposes using LLM-based reasoning to augment hotel recommendation systems with explainability and personalized insights.

💭 Reflections

This project helped deepen my understanding of how LLMs + data mining can:

Simplify complex review data

Provide meaningful insights to users

Improve user experience in travel platforms

Build trust through transparent recommendations

It also highlights the importance of human oversight when LLMs are included in real-world decision systems.
