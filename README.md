📘 Enhancing Hotel Recommendations with AI: LLM-Based Review Summarization & Query-Driven Insights

CMPE 255 — Data Mining Short Story Assignment

Author: Alekya Gudise

🧾 Project Overview

This repository contains my CMPE 255 Data Mining Short Story Project, based on the research paper:

“Stop Scrolling, Start Asking: How AI and LLMs Are Revolutionizing Your Hotel Booking Experience”
🔗 (Selected Topic – ArXiv Paper): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18277

The project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) transform hotel recommendation systems by summarizing user reviews, extracting semantic meaning, and offering query-driven insights to guide travelers toward better decisions. It investigates how AI can process unstructured hotel reviews to produce structured, personalized recommendations.

🧠 Core Data Mining Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates several data-mining and machine-learning principles:

Text processing & feature extraction

Semantic understanding via embeddings

Clustering of similar themes

Query-driven summarization

LLM-powered knowledge distillation

Sentiment and theme analysis

Evaluation of LLM reasoning quality

📄 Paper Summary

LLM-powered summarization significantly improves clarity compared to raw reviews.

Query-driven user insights (e.g., “best hotel for families”) show strong contextual reasoning.

Classical ML struggles with nuanced user intent compared to LLMs.

Study demonstrates real-world potential for AI-augmented travel planning systems.
