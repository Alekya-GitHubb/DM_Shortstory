### 🧾 Project Overview

This repository contains my CMPE 255 Data Mining Short Story Project, based on the research paper:

> **“Stop Scrolling, Start Asking: How AI and LLMs Are Revolutionizing Your Hotel Booking Experience”** > 🔗 **Selected Topic (ArXiv Paper):** [Read the Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18277)

The project explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** transform hotel recommendation systems by summarizing user reviews, extracting semantic meaning, and offering query-driven insights to guide travelers toward better decisions. It investigates how AI can process unstructured hotel reviews to produce structured, personalized recommendations.

📄 Paper Summary & Findings
✅ Clarity: LLM-powered summarization significantly improves clarity compared to raw reviews.

✅ Context: Query-driven user insights (e.g., “best hotel for families”) show strong contextual reasoning.

✅ Comparison: Classical ML struggles with nuanced user intent compared to LLMs.

✅ Potential: The study demonstrates real-world potential for AI-augmented travel planning systems.

💡 Reflections
This project explores how data mining, AI, and LLMs enhance user experiences in the travel domain. Understanding user intent, summarizing opinions, and generating actionable insights demonstrate how modern LLMs can improve hotel search and booking systems. The findings reveal the promise of hybrid human-AI systems for practical decision-making.
