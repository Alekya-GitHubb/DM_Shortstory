### 🧾 Project Overview

This repository contains my CMPE 255 Data Mining Short Story Project, based on the research paper:

> **“Stop Scrolling, Start Asking: How AI and LLMs Are Revolutionizing Your Hotel Booking Experience”** > 🔗 **Selected Topic (ArXiv Paper):** [Read the Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18277)

The project explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** transform hotel recommendation systems by summarizing user reviews, extracting semantic meaning, and offering query-driven insights to guide travelers toward better decisions. It investigates how AI can process unstructured hotel reviews to produce structured, personalized recommendations.

### 🧠 Core Data Mining Concepts

This project demonstrates the following key data-mining concepts:

Text summarization and extraction

Sentiment-aware review analysis

Dimensionality reduction via embeddings

Semantic search using LLMs

Query-driven recommendation

Anomaly detection in review signals

Model evaluation (precision, recall, usefulness)

---

### 📜 Paper Summary

LLM-based review understanding provides richer context for hotel recommendations.

Traditional ML systems struggle with nuance, sarcasm, and multi-aspect reviews.

LLMs enable personalized Q&A-driven recommendations, improving user experience.

Embeddings help convert text into meaningful numerical vectors for clustering & retrieval.

The study demonstrates a scalable approach for real-world recommendation systems.
